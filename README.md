# Airbnb-Revenue-Drivers-Analysis

## Primary Analysis Goal
This project looks at Airbnb listings in London, analysing the relationship between their
‘host-controllable’ characteristics and their monthly revenue differential from their peer
group average. The goal is to explore which characteristics drive above average revenues –
to inform practical changes a host can make to their listing to outcompete peers.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a snapshot of all London listings on Airbnb – sourced from [insideairbnb.com](http://www.insideairbnb.com).

## Analysis Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand structure of data and inform
further analysis
2. Select and train appropriate models to estimate a listing’s revenue relative to peers
based on its characteristics.
3. Examine most important characteristics driving revenue performance, as estimated
by each model
4. Interpret practical insights arising from these estimates on ways a host can improve
their listing’s revenue performance.
